# My personal blog's backend

It's intended to have a "microservices" layout

_Overkill_ is my business, my business is good... But loosely following a hexagonal architecture

Not intended to be a simple and elegant solution... I'm just using this as an excuse for testing out different transports and get in touch with cumbersome ops

## TODO

-  A huge one: explain the architecture...
